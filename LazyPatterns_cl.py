    Lazy Rule Learner — truly lazy, no rules mined upfront.

    fit():
        Stores training data and computes a per-feature purity weight.
        Purity weight for feature f = max purity achieved by f alone
        across both its values (0 and 1). Higher weight = more discriminating
        = removed last during pruning.

    predict_single():
        Starts with all selected features active for the test instance.
        Checks if training rows matching on all active features are pure
        enough and numerous enough — if yes, majority vote among matches.
        If not, removes the lowest-weight feature and tries again.
        Repeats until a match is found or all features are exhausted.
        Falls back to majority class only as last resort.

    The "rule" for each instance is the subset of its own features
    that survived pruning before a match was found.
